# Project Purpose

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a scalable, user-friendly, and privacy-first mobile application that helps users manage their photo albums. By using **CoreML** for local inference, the app will categorize photos into predefined groups like **Scenes**, **Selfies**, **Memes**, and others, while also providing a **global map** view for scene categorization and a **selfie** classification feature.

## Core Objectives
1. **Automatic Categorization**: Use machine learning models to categorize photos (Scenes, Selfies, Memes, etc.) into predefined groups.
2. **Location-based Categorization**: Display photos on a **global map** to show where each scene was taken.
3. **Selfie Detection**: Automatically detect and classify **selfies** vs. **non-selfies**.
4. **Privacy**: All processing should occur locally on the device, ensuring no user data is uploaded to a cloud server.
5. **Mobile Performance**: The models should be optimized for mobile devices, ensuring fast and efficient inference.

## Benefits
- **Privacy**: No need for users to upload their images to the cloud for processing.
- **Efficiency**: Run inference directly on the mobile device for fast responses.
- **User Experience**: Simplifies the process of managing large photo libraries by automating categorization and offering a smooth interface.

## Final Goal
To provide users with a simple, efficient, and privacy-conscious solution for managing their photos, leveraging the power of CoreML to handle inference locally on iOS devices.
